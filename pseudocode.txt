- When game loads:
    - Initialize all state variables by calling init()
    - Update the display by calling render()
    - Make sure the hit, stay, and restart buttons don't show

- When Let's start is pressed:
  - The Let's Start button goes away and the other buttons appear
  - Also the start text goes away
  - Create a card class that has your values and suits

  - Create and store 52 cards in a variable called Deck
    - suits: clubs, hearts, diamonds, spades
    - values: A, 2 - 10, J, Q, K
    - create a card object with suits and values

    - Make a shuffle function by using the deck that randomly picks a card from the deck
      - Go through the deck and create a random index
      - Use the random index on the deck to shuffle it

    - Create a deal function that:
      - Returns number cards picked at random from the deck
      - Take number of cards from the top of the deck

  - Deal 2 cards to the player and dealer
  - Make the the two cards dealt appear on the DOM, create functions to do that
  - Create a Hit function that adds a card to the player and another function to add that to the DOM by appending it to the players div
  - Create a Stay function that adds a card to the dealer and another function to add that to the DOM by appending it to the dealers div
  - Create a function for score that compares the values to the points object I setup
  - Create a function that has the score of the dealer and player by using the above function

  - Make a function that gets the score and compares for the game win logic
    - If they are both 21 then tie
    - If one player has a higher score than the other but below 21 they win and game ends
    - If any player is above 21 the other player wins game ends

- Restart the game by Initializing the scores, cards, and text-area

- Render function calls back printing out of the dealer and player cards
  - Also prints the scores to the DOM and checks the game win logic
